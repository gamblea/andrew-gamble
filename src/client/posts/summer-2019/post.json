  "text": "This summer I worked at Intel's Programmable Solutions group in downtown Toronto. At intel I was part of the Quartus Prime Timing Analysis Team. Aside from work I spent most my time exploring the city and eating a lot of food. On the weekends I would go play volleyball or head up north to one of my friend's cottages. All in the all the summer was a good balance of work and play."
